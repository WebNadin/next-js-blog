 ![Website working gif](https://github.com/WebNadin/next-js-blog/blob/master/readme-img.gif)

 You could see here an example of blog. Home page contains user information styled components, last posts cards and
 link to open every post page, loading visualization while posts are getting from server. Click on post card will
 open single post page (one template for all posts).

 In this project I mastered:
 - TypeScript
 - ESLint and Prettier
 - Next.js
 - styled-components
 - React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRoutes) instead of class-based components
 - axios


### Installation

You could follow next steps to deploy a local project:
 - clone branch `master` with `git clone https://github.com/WebNadin/next-js-blog.git` or fork it and then clone it
 from your forked repo

 ```
